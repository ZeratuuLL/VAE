# VAE

Full name for VAE is Variational Auto-Encoder. It is a special case of AEVB(Auto-Encoding VB) algorithm when the recognition model. There will also be a short introduction for this in the jupyter notebook. For more details please read the original paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)

In the jupyter notebook, I use pytorch to implement this encoder and trained it separately on MNIST and some images collected from Pong game to see the effect.
